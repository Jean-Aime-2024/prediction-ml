House Price Prediction Dashboard
Overview
This project provides a web-based dashboard that predicts house prices based on various features such as square footage, number of rooms, house age, distance to the city, and the presence of a garage or garden. The prediction is powered by a machine learning model built using scikit-learn and is accessible via a FastAPI backend. The frontend is built with React, displaying the predicted house price and visualizing prediction trends with charts.

Architecture
The application is composed of two main parts:

Backend: A FastAPI application that handles the prediction logic using a machine learning model.
Frontend: A React application that allows users to input house details and view the predicted price along with charts.
Backend
The backend is built with FastAPI and exposes an endpoint /predict for making price predictions. The prediction is based on a Linear Regression model that is trained using a small dataset of house features and corresponding prices.

Technologies Used:
Python
FastAPI
scikit-learn (for machine learning)
numpy (for data handling)
Pydantic (for data validation)
Setting up the Backend:
Navigate to the backend directory.
Install the required Python dependencies:
bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Start the FastAPI server:
bash
Copy
Edit
uvicorn backend.main:app --reload
This will start the API at http://127.0.0.1:8000.
Frontend
The frontend is built with React and provides an intuitive form where users can input details of a house to predict its price. It also displays charts for visualizing the prediction trends over time.

Technologies Used:
React
Chart.js (for visualizations)
Axios (for API requests)
Setting up the Frontend:
Navigate to the client directory.
Install the required dependencies:
bash
Copy
Edit
npm install
Start the React development server:
bash
Copy
Edit
npm start
This will start the React app at http://localhost:3000.
Communication
The frontend communicates with the backend via HTTP POST requests to the /predict endpoint. The response includes the predicted house price, which is then displayed on the frontend. The prediction history is also stored and displayed in the form of a chart.

Features
Prediction Form: Users can input various house features such as square footage, number of rooms, and other attributes.
Price Prediction: The app predicts the house price based on the input features.
Prediction History: Past predictions are stored and displayed as a chart.
Visualization: Display predicted prices over time using Line, Bar, and Pie charts.
How to Use
Start the backend server by running uvicorn backend.main:app --reload from the backend directory.
Start the frontend server by running npm start from the client directory.
Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.
Enter the house details and click "Predict Price" to view the predicted house price and charts.
